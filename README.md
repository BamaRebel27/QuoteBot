This is a bot I made with zero experience prior. I was learning the whole way, it has constantly been revised. I have not added the
.env file to this for assumed reasons, it is not needed to run. However this code does use node.js, I could not figure out how to add
the file to this due to its massive size. Once I can recall all that I imported, I will make a list of what all is used.
